# DS201 <br>
> Fall 2018 

The first class in the Data Science minor, using this to store/showcase some of the data science things I have done. This is also being used to emphasize my progress as I move forward with the minor and data science in general. I have had some exposure to python, mainly in side projects. This is the first I have any formal instruction on data modeling and the first time I have used any ML. <br>
